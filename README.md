## About the Book
Three.js and Next.js are revolutionizing how we build interactive web experiences, especially for industrial and multipurpose applications. This book unlocks their combined power, showing you how to create immersive 3D visualizations and dynamic web solutions that drive efficiency and innovation in various sectors.

Beginning with the evolution and capabilities of 3D web development, this book covers the foundational tools, setting up your environment for Three.js, Next.js, AWS Amplify, Storybook, and Tailwind CSS. It then explores Three.js fundamentals, covering geometries, materials, lighting, cameras, textures, user interactions, and animations to create dynamic 3D scenes. The book then seamlessly integrates Three.js with Next.js, teaching data management, state handling, and advanced interaction patterns. Crucially, you will learn vital optimization techniques and leverage AWS Amplify for secure hosting, user authentication, data storage, and real-time functionalities. The final sections guide you in establishing a consistent UI design system with Storybook, culminating in a complete, practical application.

Upon completing this book, you will possess a strong command of cutting-edge web and 3D technologies, enabling you to confidently design, build, and deploy sophisticated industrial and multipurpose web applications with immersive 3D experiences.
